The project requied the oloowing:

Your first project is to complete and deploy your personal website. This is a chance to practice all the skills you are learning, and show off your HTML & CSS ability. It's also a chance to make a start on something that will probably stay with you for the rest of your career!

## Basic requirements

Your personal site must be responsive and include:

- Some form of site navigation (eg a hamburger menu).
- More than one page (or for a single-page site, scroll navigation).

It **should not include placeholder content**. If you are struggling for content, speak to Jonanthan, or one of the DM instructors or students.

## Technical requirements

You haven't learned all these things yet, but you can add themto your project as you cover these topics.

It must use the following technologies:

- HTML and CSS 
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Web Fonts

## Deployment requirements

The site should be deployed to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) on your personal account. If you own a domain name, feel free to add that too ðŸ™‚
